title: "Learning Module 2: Risk Management (NG-SOC LM2)"
description: |
  Training scenario comprising two hands-on exercises focused on proactive
  cybersecurity risk management in critical sectors (financial and energy).
  Learners use the RITA platform for dynamic risk analysis throughout the
  exercises.
  Participants take on the role of a Cybersecurity Risk Manager for (1) a
  banking institution and (2) an energy infrastructure, conducting asset
  identification and threat modelling, risk assessment (likelihood and impact),
  and designing mitigations. Exercises are aligned with frameworks such as
  MITRE ATT&CK, STRIDE, and the ENISA European Cybersecurity Skills Framework
  (ECSF), and are tailored for intermediate to advanced learners in roles such
  as Risk Manager and Security Architect. The training includes supporting
  artefacts (e.g., network diagrams, risk matrices) and guided steps.
prerequisites:
  - >
    Basic cybersecurity knowledge (threats, vulnerabilities, security controls).
  - >
    Familiarity with risk assessment methodologies (e.g. ISO 27005, NIST 800-30)
    and attack frameworks.
outcomes:
  - >
    Apply threat modelling methodologies (e.g. STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK) to identify
    vulnerabilities and attack scenarios in banking and ICS/SCADA systems.
  - >
    Qualitatively assess risks (likelihood and impact) and prioritise them based
    on business and safety consequences.
  - >
    Recommend security controls and mitigation strategies (technical and
    procedural) aligned with defence-in-depth principles.
  - >
    Translate technical risk analysis into clear action plans for both
    technical teams and executives.
  - >
    Adapt risk management approaches to industrial (OT/ICS) environments,
    accounting for availability and physical safety considerations.
  - >
    Develop proficiency in RITA-based modelling and risk evaluation.
