## Exercises

- `Exercise 1`: Risk assessment and threat modelling in a **banking system**  

Based on:
![Diagram banking](static/diagram_banking.png)

- `Exercise 2`: ICS/SCADA-focused risk assessment for an **energy infrastructure**

Based on:
![Diagram energy](static/diagram_energy.png)

## Roles Targeted

- Cybersecurity Risk Manager
- Security Architect
- OT/ICS Security Analyst

## Standards and Frameworks

- MITRE ATT&CK
- STRIDE Threat Modelling
- ENISA ECSF Competence Mapping
- ISO 27005, IEC 62443 (for ICS)

## Usage

1. Deploy using the KYPO CRP interface.
2. Load the provided topologies and provisioning playbooks.
3. Follow the instructions in the markdown files within `content/`.

## Deployment

To run this training on the KYPO Cyber Range Platform:

1. **Install prerequisites** – Ansible 2.12+ is recommended. The provisioning playbooks use the `sysctl` module from the `ansible.posix` collection. Install it before running the playbooks:

   ```bash
   ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.posix
   ```
2. **Import the training** – Log in to KYPO CRP and navigate to *Training Management → Import*. Upload all files from this repository, including `training.yaml`.
3. **Select a sandbox variant** – When launching a scenario, choose either:
   - `sandboxes/topology_puc1.yaml` (banking use case), or
   - `sandboxes/topology_puc3.yaml` (ICS use case).
4. **Run the provisioning playbook** – For the chosen topology, execute the matching playbook from `sandboxes/provisioning_puc1/site.yml` or `sandboxes/provisioning_puc3/site.yml`.
5. **Start the exercise** – After provisioning completes, trainees can follow the steps in `content/exercise1.md` or `content/exercise2.md` as appropriate.

## Getting Started

Once the environment has been deployed, connect via **SSH** to the desired host using the management account `debian`:

```bash
ssh debian@<IP or host-name>
```

The default password is usually `debian` unless the instructor states otherwise.

Recommended workflow:

1. Open a terminal in the KYPO interface and first connect to the main analyst machine (`bank-analyst` or `corp-workstation`).
2. From there, access the remaining scenario machines with `ssh`.
3. Refer to the exercise guide in the `content/` folder (`exercise1.md` or `exercise2.md`).
4. Save notes and evidence in your home directory (`/home/debian`) or in the location specified by the course.
